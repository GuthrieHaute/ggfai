ml_layer/intent_engine.py (Latest "Hardened" Version):

Current State: This version has an excellent structure with robust resilience (circuit breaker, retry, timeout), error handling (pydantic ErrorContext), concurrency (thread pool for resource checks), caching, and dynamic configuration loading (emergency protocols).
What's Missing/Needs Finishing:
Core Intent Processing Logic: This is the main gap. The _execute_processing(self, intent: Dict) -> Dict method is just a placeholder. It needs to be implemented to actually:
Take the input data (which might be raw text, structured data from voice.py, or fused multi-modal data).
Use the appropriate NLP libraries (spaCy, Rasa, Transformers?) and/or ML models (loaded via ModelAdapter, potentially calling Ollama for GGUF models) to analyze the input.
Determine the user's intent.
Extract relevant entities or parameters.
Generate the final, structured output dictionary that represents the recognized intent tag (ready to be potentially converted into a Tag object by the caller or TagRegistry).
(Refinement) Multi-Modal Fusion: If the engine needs to combine inputs from different sources (like snippet_fuse_intents.py demonstrated conceptually), that logic needs to be incorporated, likely within _execute_processing or a preceding step in process_intent.
(Refinement/Security) eval() Usage: Consider replacing the eval() in _load_emergency_protocols with a safer method if the source of the protocol definitions in Redis cannot be absolutely trusted (e.g., use a dictionary mapping protocol names to function references).
